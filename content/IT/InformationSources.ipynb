    "## A mathematical definition of information\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to analyze information generation, encoding and transmission \n",
    "with mathematical tools,\n",
    "we need a solid and clear definition of information.\n",
    "\n",

    "- Source: creates information messages \n",
    "- Encoder: converts messages into symbols for transmission (i.e bits)\n",
    "- Channel: delivers the symbols, introduces errors\n",
    "- Decoder: detects/corrects the errors, rebuilds the information messages -->\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is information?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start first with some simple examples of messages carrying information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the sentence: \n",
    "\n",
    "> \"Poli Iași (the local football team) lost the last match\" \n",
    "\n",
    "Does this message carry information? How, why, how much?\n",
    "\n",
    "When thinking about the information brought by such a phrase, let's consider the following facts:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - the message carries information only when you don't already know the result\n",
    "  - if you already known the result, the message is useless (brings no information)\n",
    "  - if the result was to be expected, there is little information (e.g. suppose Poli Iași plays agains FC Barcelona)\n",
    "  - if the result is highly unusual, there is more information in this message\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Example\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand why the amount of information involved here\n",
    "depends on whether the result is to be expected or is highly unusual,\n",
    "consider a case when information is valuable, for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - in an exam or quiz with multiple-choice answers (e.g. Who Wants to be a Millionaire)\n",
    "  - in sports betting (gambling), \n",
    "\n",
    "The amount you gain depends on the amount of information you have on the topic: those who know a lot compared to others win a lot,\n",
    "those who know little win just a little. But you're not winning a fortune\n",
    "by answering easy questions which most people know, or betting on result which everybody expects.\n",
    "We explain this by the fact that there is little information involved in them.\n",
    "You do win a lot by answering hard questions or betting on surprising results,\n",
    "and since it's the information which is valuable, it shows that unexpected outcomes have lots of information.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Information and events\n",
    "\n",
    "As seen in the example above, the notion of information requires a probabilistic setting.\n",
    "\n",
    "We define the notion of **information** for a **probabilistic event**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- an event may or may not happen, and when it does happen, it creates information\n",
    "\n",
    "- the information is: \"this event happened\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- the amount of information depends on the **probability** of that event\n",
    "\n",
    "```{hint}\n",
    "As a rule of thumb, keep in mind:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - if you can guess something most of the times, it has little information\n",
    "  - if something is unexpected, it has a lot of information\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Question\n",
    "Let's answer some questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - does a sure event (p = 1) bring any information?\n",
    "  - does an almost sure event (e.g. P = 0.9999)  bring little or much information?\n",
    "  - does a rare event (e.g. P = 0.0001) bring a little or much information?\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Definition of information\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this class, we refer to a probabilistic event as a **\"message\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "The information attached to a message $s_i$ is rigorously defined as:\n",
    "$$i(s_i) = -\\log_2(p(s_i))$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Consequences of this definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Information of an event is always non-negative: \n",
    "\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  i(s_i) \\geq 0\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Lower probability (rare events) means higher information\n",
    "  - Higher probability (frequent events) means lower information\n",
    "  - The certain event ($p = 1)$ brings no information: \n",
    "\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  -\\log(1) = 0\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "\n",
    "  - An event with probability $0$ brings infinite information (but it never happens...)\n",
    "  - When two independent $s_i$ and $s_j$ events take place, their information gets added:\n",
    "  \n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  \\begin{align}\n",
    "  i(s_i \\cap s_j) &= -log_2(p(s_i \\cap s_j) \\\\\n",
    "  &= -log_2(p(s_i) \\cdot p(s_j) \\\\\n",
    "  &= -log_2(p(s_i) - log_2(p(s_j)) \\\\\n",
    "  &= i(s_i) + i(s_j)\n",
    "  \\end{align}\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The choice of logarithm\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the logarithm function in the definition is crucial, \n",
    "since it is responsible for most of these properties.\n",
    "In particular, the fact that logarithm transforms a product into a sum\n",
    "allws to sum the informations of independent events.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any base of logarithm can be used in the definition, not just base 2, \n",
    "and all the consequences still hold.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - By convention, we typically use the binary logarithm $\\log_2()$.\n",
    "    In this case, the information $i(s_i)$ is measured in **bits**\n",
    "\n",
    "  - We could use instead the natural logarithm $ln()$, and the result\n",
    "    is measured in *nats*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of the algorithm is not critical and doesn't change anything fundamental,\n",
    "since logarithm bases can always be converted to/from one another:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\log_b(x) = \\frac{\\log_a(x)}{\\log_a(b)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that information defined using different logarithms differ only by a scaling factor:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "i_b(s_i) =\\frac{i_a(s_i)}{\\log_a(b)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Following the convention of the scientific literature, we shall use the base 2 logarithm $log_2()$ from now on.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Information Source\n",
    "\n",
    "A probabilistic event is always part of a set of multiple events, \n",
    "containing all the possible outcomes which can happen at a given time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each event (known as \"message\") has its own probability, which are all known beforehand.\n",
    "At a given time, only one of the events can happen. \n",
    "This carries the information that **it** happened (out of all possible events),\n",
    "and the quantity information quantity is dependent of the probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "We define an **information source** as the set of all events,\n",
    "together with their probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "  - a football team can win / lose / draw a match (3 possible events)\n",
    "\n",
    "The set of all messages forms the \"*alphabet*\" of the source.\n",
    "\n",
    "When an event takes place, we say that \"the information source generates a message\".\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sequence of messages\n",
    "\n",
    "We are very rarely interested in a single message. \n",
    "Instead, we are interested analyzing large amounts of messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "An information source creates a **sequence of messages**, by generating\n",
    "messages one after another, randomly, according to the known probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - e.g. like throwing a coin or a dice several times in a row\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on how the messages are generated, we distinguish between two types\n",
    "of information sources:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Memoryless** sources: each new message is generated independently on the previous messages\n",
    "2. Sources **with memory**: when generating a new message, the probabilities depend on one or more of the previous messages\n",
    "\n",
    "### Discrete memoryless source\n",
    "\n",
    "A **discrete memoryless source** (DMS) is an information source which produces a sequence of **independent** messages.\n",
    "The choice of a message at one time does not depend on the previous messages.\n",
    "Each message has a fixed probability, and every new message is generated randomly based on the probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "The set of probabilities is the **distribution** of the source, \n",
    "also known as a **probabilty mass function**.\n",
    "\n",
    "We represent a DMS as below, \n",
    "by giving it a name (\"S\"), listing the messages ($s_1, s_2, s_3$) and the probability distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\sIII{S}{\\fIoII}{\\fIoIV}{\\fIoIV}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "A DMS is a discrete, complete and memoryless:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Discrete**: the set of messages is a discrete set\n",
    "  - **Complete**: the sum of all probabilities is 1, which means that one and only one event must take place at a given time:\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  \\sum p(s_i) = 1\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  - **Memoryless**: each message is independent of the previous messages\n",
    "\n",
    "A good example of a DMS is a coin, or a dice.\n",
    "\n",
    "One message generated by DMS is also called a **random variable** in probabilistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Example\n",
    "\n",
    "A coin is a discrete memoryless source (DMS) with two messages:\n",

    "  \\snII{S}{0}{\\fIoII}{1}{\\fIoII}\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sequence of messages from DMS\n",
    "\n",
    "A DMS produces a sequence of messages by randomly selecting a message every time,\n",
    "with the same fixed probabilities, producing a sequence like:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "s_3 s_2 s_4 s_1 s_2 s_1 s_3 \\dots\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, throwing a dice several times in a row you can get a sequence \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "4, 2, 3, 2, 1, 6, 1, 5, 4, 5 \\dots\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In a sequence which is very long, with length $N \\to \\infty$, \n",
    "each message $s_i$ appears in the sequence approximately $p(s_i) * N$ times.\n",
    "This gets more precise as $N$ gets larger.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Entropy of a DMS\n",
    "\n",
    "We usually don't care about the information of single message. We are interested in long sequences of messages\n",
    "(think millions of bits of data).\n",
    "\n",
    "To analyze this in an easy manner, we need the *average* information of a message from a DMS.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **entropy of a DMS source** $S$ is **the average information of a message**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "H(S) = \\sum_{k} p(s_k) i(s_k) = -\\sum_{k} p(s_k) \\log_2(p_k)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $p(s_k)$  is the probability of message $k$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Since information of a message is measured in bits, \n",
    "entropy is measured in **bits** (or **bits / message**, to indicate it is an average value).\n",

    "#### Interpretation of the entropy\n",
    "\n",
    "The entropy of an information source S is a fundamental quantity. \n",
    "It allows us to compare two different sources, which model\n",
    "different scenarios from real life.\n",
    "\n",
    "All the following interpretations of entropy are true:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - $H(S)$ is the **average uncertainty** of the source S\n",
    "\n",
    "  - $H(S)$ is the **average information** of a message from source S\n",
    "\n",
    "  - A very long sequence of $N$ messages generated by source S has total information $\\approx N \\cdot H(S)$\n",
    "\n",
    "We shall see in Chapter III that the entropy $H(S)$ says something very important \n",
    "about the **number of bits** requires to represent data in binary form:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - $H(S)$ is the minimum number of bits ($0$, $1$) required to uniquely represent a message from source S, on average\n",
    "\n",
    "  - A very long sequence of $N$ messages generated by source S needs at least $\\approx N \\cdot H(S)$ bits in order to be represented in binary form\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, $H(S)$ is crucial when we discuss how to represent data efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Properties of entropy\n",
    "\n",
    "We prove the following **properties of entropy**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. $H(S) \\geq  0$ (non-negative)\n",
    "\n",
    "    Proof: via definition\n",
    "\n",
    "2. $H(S)$ is maximum when all $n$ messages have equal probability $\\frac{1}{n}$.\n",
    "The maximum value is $\\max H(S) = \\log(n)$\n",
    "\n",
    "    Proof: only for the case of 2 messages, use derivative in definition\n",
    "\n",
    "3. *Diversification* of the source always increases the entropy\n",
    "\n",
    "    Proof: compare entropies in both cases\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The entropy of a binary source\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a general DMS with two messages:\n",
    "  \n",
    "  $$\n",
